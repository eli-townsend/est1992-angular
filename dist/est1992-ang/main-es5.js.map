While working at BB&amp;T, my manager created a March Madness tournament of designers called Design or Die. During this tournament, each round was a different, yet specific challenge. The third round, also known as the final four in March Madness, was where we had to design mobile experiences and we could animate if we wanted. This challenge really allowed me to design around my passion of cycling and create the app called Fixie. It was a great experience for being able to create something from scratch and also create great interactions when the user wants to learn more about a frame and order one. This was designed with Sketch and animated in Principle. I am sure you are wondering about the results of the tournament, let's just say, I have a championship belt to prove it.\n  </p>\n\n  <video controls>\n    <source src=\"/assets/images/fixie/fixie.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\">\n    Your browser does not support the video tag.\n  </video>\n  <img src=\"/assets/images/fixie/fixie1.jpg\" alt=\"fixie image\" width=\"1600px\" height=\"1200px\" />\n  <img src=\"/assets/images/fixie/fixie2.jpg\" alt=\"fixie image\" width=\"1600px\" height=\"1200px\"/>\n  <img src=\"/assets/images/fixie/fixie3.jpg\" alt=\"fixie image\" width=\"1600px\" height=\"1200px\"/>\n  <img src=\"/assets/images/fixie/fixie4.jpg\" alt=\"fixie image\" width=\"1600px\" height=\"1200px\"/>\n  <img src=\"/assets/images/fixie/fixie5.jpg\" alt=\"fixie image\" width=\"1600px\" height=\"1200px\"/>\n  <img src=\"/assets/images/fixie/fixie6.jpg\" alt=\"fixie image\" width=\"1600px\" height=\"1200px\"/>\n  <img src=\"/assets/images/fixie/fixie7.jpg\" alt=\"fixie image\" width=\"1600px\" height=\"1200px\"/>\n  <img src=\"/assets/images/fixie/fixie8.jpg\" alt=\"fixie image\" width=\"1600px\" height=\"1200px\"/>\n</div>","import { Component, OnInit, Input } from '@angular/core';\n\n@Component({\n  selector: 'est-project-figure',\n  templateUrl: './est-project-figure.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./est-project-figure.component.scss']\n})\nexport class EstProjectFigureComponent implements OnInit {\n\n  @Input() estProjectFigureClasses: string;\n  @Input() estProjectFigureImagePath: string;\n  @Input() estProjectFigureImageAlt: string;\n  @Input() estProjectFigureCaption: string;\n\n  constructor() { }\n\n  ngOnInit(): void {\n  }\n\n}\n","<figure class=\"{{estProjectFigureClasses}}\">\n  <img src=\"{{estProjectFigureImagePath}}\" alt=\"{{estProjectFigureImageAlt}}\" class=\"case-study-img\" />\n  <figcaption>{{estProjectFigureCaption}}</figcaption>\n</figure>\n","import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';\n\n@Component({\n  selector: 'app-what-is-cycling',\n  templateUrl: './what-is-cycling.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['../../workshop.component.scss']\n})\nexport class WhatIsCyclingComponent implements OnInit {\n\n  constructor() { }\n\n  ngOnInit(): void {\n  }\n\n}\n","<est-project-entry\n  projectTitle=\"What Is Cycling\"\n  projectLink=\"https://www.whatiscycling.com/\"\n  projectLinkName=\"whatiscycling.com\"\n  projectYear=\"2021\"\n>\n  <ul class=\"color-scheme-list\">\n    <li style=\"background: #000\"></li>\n    <li style=\"background: #fff\"></li>\n    <li style=\"background: #002aff\"></li>\n  </ul>\n</est-project-entry>\n      \n<div class=\"clear\"></div>\n\n<div class=\"row\">\n  <p class=\"entry\">\n    What Is Cycling is a multi episode video series that features individual cyclists around the community and the different types of riding that makes them unique.\n  </p>\n\n  <img src=\"/assets/images/what-is-cycling/wic-banner.jpg\" alt=\"what is cycling banner\" />\n\n  <p>\n    What Is Cycling is not just a video series but a community project that I started to hopefully make cycling all inclusive so that everyone feels welcome and not intimidated.

Looking at the old website, the header was so busy that it felt impossible to find what you are looking for (the screenshot does not show the chaos in the dropdowns) and the footer became a catch all for any link that needed to be on the site but did not require priority in the hierarchy. \n  </p>\n\n  <figure>\n    <img src=\"/assets/images/old-odfl.jpg\" alt=\"old odfl web page image\" class=\"case-study-img\" width=\"1342px\" height=\"871px\" />\n    <figcaption>ODFL.com before 2014 - archive.org</figcaption>\n  </figure>\n\n  <p>\n    Once we began to dissect the old site through card sorting and establishing the hierarchy of the site's content, we began creating <a href=\"http://styletil.es/\" target=\"_blank\">style tiles</a> to start getting approval for site branding. While the style tiles were in the review process, we then began to create lo-fidelity mockups to present to the product owners.\n  </p>\n\n  <figure class=\"est-margin-bottom-lg\">\n    <img src=\"/assets/images/styletile1.png\" alt=\"odfl style tile image\" class=\"case-study-img\" />\n    <figcaption>One of many Style Tiles</figcaption>\n  </figure>\n\n  <figure class=\"est-margin-bottom-lg\">\n    <img src=\"/assets/images/finalDashboard.jpg\" alt=\"odfl dashboard mockup image\" class=\"case-study-img\" />\n    <figcaption>Dashboard Balsamiq Mockup</figcaption>\n  </figure>\n\n  <figure>\n    <img src=\"/assets/images/finalMobile.jpg\" alt=\"odfl mobile mockup image\" class=\"case-study-img__height\" />\n    <figcaption>Mobile Balsamiq Mockup</figcaption>\n  </figure>\n\n  <p>\n    The mockups displayed a cleaner look for the header and footer along with different home/landing page layouts. Once we were able to define and provide the understanding of responsive design and mobile first, the business was on board with the direction that we were moving in. My team then created two hi-fidelity mockups for the business so that they could make the decision on styles. We went through many iterations of design critiquing layout, changing color schemes and textures for business approval. ODFL.com was developed mobile first and simplified the process on numerous applications by removing steps to reach the same success criteria.\n  </p> \n\n  <figure>\n    <img src=\"/assets/images/odfl-psd-desktop.jpg\" alt=\"odfl desktop mockup image\" class=\"case-study-img\" />\n    <figcaption>I know, nothing about this passes accessibility</figcaption>\n  </figure>\n\n  <p>ODFL is very form and data heavy, therefore, simplifying the applications for customers saved them time and provided a service they trusted. ODFL.com had 30,000+ daily users and generated over $3 billion dollars (2016). With 75% of the companies revenue coming from the website, we did extensive testing on the web applications utilizing Google Analytics to solidify our design decisions. If we saw a pattern of a high bounce rate through an application flow, we had to be able to pin point what the friction was and solve the issue, then we would reiterate this process. \n  </p>\n\n  <figure class=\"est-margin-bottom-lg\">\n    <img src=\"/assets/images/odfl.jpg\" alt=\"odfl web page image\" />\n    <figcaption>Redesigned ODFL.com</figcaption>\n  </figure>\n\n  <figure class=\"est-margin-bottom-lg\">\n    <img src=\"/assets/images/transit-time-search1.png\" alt=\"transit time search\" />\n    <figcaption>Transit time search initial</figcaption>\n  </figure>\n\n  <figure>\n    <img src=\"/assets/images/transit-time-search2.png\" alt=\"transit time search results\"/>\n    <figcaption>Transit time search results</figcaption>\n  </figure>\n\n  <p>\n    Of course when you give users something completely new, they have trouble adapting because it looks different.

Once a dock worker or driver would scan the PRO#, it would add a new step in the PRO# lifecycle. This application is used by eighty percent of the departments in the company which already puts a strain on the design process. Instead of using the tradition ui/ux design process, everyone wanted a say in the application's design and it turned into a design by committee. The issue with the older version of the app was that there was not a good way to change from step to step. The key feature that was requested was the ability to easily transition from one step in the process to the next and the ability to go back. In the ideation phase of the design process, I presented the idea of using a horizontal timeline to show each step in the lifecycle. Different groups wanted different features, but the horizontal timeline was one solution because you could use the mouse to change points but also be able to use the arrow keys to change points. Certain teams were very reliant on the keyboard for quicker production, so the solution had to take into account keyboard usage. We also created a active tooltip to label which step you are in the process. Another piece of functionality is the hover effect tooltip for non-active points. This showed the user which step was next or previous but gave them the ability to jump multiple steps.\n  </p>\n\n  <img src=\"/assets/images/timeline2.png\" alt=\"horizontal timeline image\" width=\"1024px\" height=\"5264px\" />\n\n  <p>\n    This experience was a great learning tool in setting expectations for a project, not letting the scope grow and properly define deliverables.

If you sign up to bank with Tapples, everyone starts out on with the same account and depending on your financial stability, your accound will be upgraded to another tier. Before we get into more detail about the banking methodologies, let's go over what issues Tapples would help solve. From working in finance, two constant battles from creator to user is education and stability. When I refer to education, I am not discussing interactions between the user and the bank, I am discussing the interaction between the user and their money. Most users do not follow a monthly budget or put very much money towards their savings in case of an emergency. When I discuss stability, I am talking about the stability of their finances. In case another covid happens, are you going to be financialy stable?\n  </p>\n\n  <ul>\n    <li>Nearly 1 in 10 workers making $100,000+ live paycheck to paycheck</li>\n    <li>More than 1 in 4 workers do not set aside any savings each month</li>\n    <li>Nearly 3 in 4 workers say they are in debt - and more than half think they always will be</li>\n    <li>More than half of minimum wage workers say they have to work more than one job to make ends meet</li>\n    <li>28% of workers making $50,000-$99,999 usually or always live paycheck to paycheck, and 70% are in debt</li>\n  </ul>\n\n  <img src=\"/assets/images/tapples/tapples3.png\" alt=\"tapples image three\" />\n\n  <p>\n    How do we fix these two areas of banking? First, we need to educate our users. We need to give them information on steps they can take to become financially stable and provide them with tips on how to bank smarter. Secondly, we need to try and set up the user to be more stable in the instance of a disaster. We put it on their mind that we want them to have fun, but we also need to look out for them because we care. Third, we need to make banking more interactive, and not the interaction of moving money from account to account, but the interaction of persuading the user to save money or to create a budget or to pay off their loan. Lastly, we need to challenge our users in a different way and reward them when they complete whatever task we have appointed them. \n  </p>\n\n  <img src=\"/assets/images/tapples/tapples4.png\" alt=\"tapples image four\" >\n\n  <p>\n    Not only do users all have the same account, but they all start out on the same level. This is what I am calling the Tiered Banking System. We have a system that allows you to gain perks, complete tasks and become more financially stable based on the task provided. The tasks are everyday things that are easily achievable but usually people do not think about these steps. These tasks are not impossible, like performing three back flips to get free checking, personally I cannot do that, nor do I want to. It is as simple as opening up a Checking Add-On and depositing $200 into the new add-on. On the dashboard we want to show the current tier that the user is in and which tier is next to see the next achievable step along with the task it takes to get there. \n  </p>\n\n  <img src=\"/assets/images/tapples/tapples5.png\" alt=\"tapples image five\" />\n\n  <p>\n    We have created a way to help improve the financial stability of our users and gave banking a gamification aspect, but what does that do for us? This allows us as a bank to encourage our users, lift them up when they make a mistake and give them praise when they accomplish something new. We can also use this opportunity to promote our products and suggest which products would fit the needs of the user more. Looking at tier seven, you see that the task at hand is to open a Roth IRA, that is the specific add-on that I am pushing for in this example but, it can be any add-on, any credit card, and any account service like checks. Ultimately, this is our brand. We care about those who bank with us and we want them to be successful in every aspect of their life. We have the skills and resources to do that, we just have to get the ball rolling. By implementing something like the Tier Banking System, we can help prevent overdraft fees, penalties, and even lower customer service calls. How can we lower customer service calls? By making the rewards useful to the users, for example overdraft fee waivers just in case they have a slip up but we are also educating the user moving forward, therefore, they will not continue to have these issues again.\n  </p>\n\n  <img src=\"/assets/images/tapples/tapples6.png\" alt=\"tapples image six\" />\n  <img src=\"/assets/images/tapples/tapples7.png\" alt=\"tapples image seven\" />\n\n  <p>\n    The interaction that we can have with the user after they complete a task should give them a sense of confidence and promote them to moving further into financial stability. Just like many applications: Duolingo, Garmin Connect, Todoist, Starbucks and many more, we can build better habits and more interaction through challenging our users, rewarding our user and showing the user that the moves they take will literally pay off in the end.\n  </p>\n</div>","import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';\n\n@Component({\n  selector: 'app-od-move',\n  templateUrl: './od-move.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['../../workshop.component.scss']\n})\nexport class OdMoveComponent implements OnInit {\n\n  constructor() { }\n\n  ngOnInit(): void {\n  }\n\n}\n","<est-project-entry\n  projectTitle=\"OD Move\"\n  projectLink=\"https://www.odmove.com/ODMove/\"\n  projectLinkName=\"odmove.com\"\n  projectYear=\"2015\"\n>\n  <ul class=\"color-scheme-list\">\n    <li style=\"background: #25a35a\"></li>\n    <li style=\"background: #4d4d4d;\"></li>\n    <li style=\"background: #999999\"></li>\n  </ul>\n</est-project-entry>\n      \n<div class=\"clear\"></div>\n\n<div class=\"row\">\n  <p class=\"entry\">\n    OD Move is a customer facing service provided by Old Dominion Freight Line, also known as OD Household Services.

Being the lead designer for this project, I was able to meet with the business to obtain specs and ask questions about how the site and business were going to work together. In meeting with the business, we had to distinguish what the requirements were while meeting with users to validate the user experience we had designed. One key improvement towards the initial process was by investigating, researching, and testing our Instant Estimate. We white boarded different scenarios but ultimately created a great product by simplifying this process for a decrease of 50% of user clicks to get through the entire application.\n  </p>\n\n  <figure class=\"est-margin-bottom-lg\">\n    <img src=\"/assets/images/old-odmove.jpg\" alt=\"old odmove image\" class=\"case-study-img\" />\n    <figcaption>odmove.com before redesign</figcaption>\n  </figure>\n\n  <p>\n    Before we get into the rest of branding and the design of the website, I want to draw your attention to the Instant Estimate. The overall goal was to create a simpler process for the customer. The old Instant Estimate required too much information than what was actually needed to submit the form. It turned out that the reason that all of this information was needed was for marketing so they could send out offers and keep the clients in the loop. We still did not feel like that was a good enough reason to force the user's hand in fillng out the information this early in the process. The user is more than likely going through numerous services and trying to get the lowest quote possible, therefore, we want to provide them with the Instant Estimate as quickly as we can. After simplifying the process down to Origin Zip, Destination Zip, Moving Date and Size of the move, we then moved the marketing information to the following step. We took a nine step form for the initial Instant Estimate down to a four step form. This allowed for quicker quotes, while also allowing the marketing department to get the information they needed to supply the users with discounts, how-to videos, and potential offers.\n  </p>\n\n  <figure class=\"est-margin-bottom-lg\">\n    <img src=\"/assets/images/odmove/styletile1.jpg\" alt=\"style tile\" class=\"case-study-img\" />\n    <figcaption>1-2 style tiles presented to business</figcaption>\n  </figure>\n \n  <figure class=\"est-margin-bottom-lg\">\n    <img src=\"/assets/images/odmove/styletile2.jpg\" alt=\"style tile\" class=\"case-study-img\" />\n    <figcaption>2-2 style tiles presented to business</figcaption>\n  </figure>\n\n  <p>\n    After we established the direction with the brand of the site, we focused next on the hierarchy and structure. We presented two ideas for the layout of the site. First, we designed a full width and height website where each page took up the entire viewport with no scrolling. The second design was a single page scroll until you filled out the form to quote your move. That form would take you to another page in the flow. Here are examples of mockups that were presented to the business.\n  </p>\n\n  <figure class=\"est-margin-bottom-lg\">\n    <img src=\"/assets/images/odmove/single1.jpg\" alt=\"single section image\" class=\"case-study-img\" />\n    <figcaption>1-3 single section design</figcaption>\n  </figure>\n  \n  <figure class=\"est-margin-bottom-lg\">\n    <img src=\"/assets/images/odmove/single2.jpg\" alt=\"single section image\" class=\"case-study-img\" />\n    <figcaption>2-3 single section design</figcaption>\n  </figure>\n\n  <figure class=\"est-margin-bottom-lg\">\n    <img src=\"/assets/images/odmove/single3.jpg\" alt=\"single section image\" class=\"case-study-img\" />\n    <figcaption>3-3 single section design</figcaption>\n  </figure>\n  \n  <figure class=\"est-margin-bottom-lg\">\n    <img src=\"/assets/images/odmove/scroll1.jpg\" alt=\"single page scroll image\" class=\"case-study-img\" />\n    <figcaption>1-2 single page scroll design</figcaption>\n  </figure>\n  \n  <figure class=\"est-margin-bottom-lg\">\n    <img src=\"/assets/images/odmove/scroll2.jpg\" alt=\"single page scroll image\" class=\"case-study-img\" />\n    <figcaption>2-2 single page scroll design</figcaption>\n  </figure>\n\n  <p>\n    The decision was made that we were going to be designing for a single page scroll site. Single page scroll sites are nice because you do not have to worry about linking and other page designs, but you do have to worry about animation and making sure the hierarchy of the page keeps the user moving down the page or completing the desired outcome.

We designed with careful consideration for business requirements, user feedback, and usability findings. One day, my product owner came to me and explained an issue we were having with users not being able to find certain features from the account details page. Customer service was being called due to the users being unable to find account settings, order checks, and find other needed links. \n  </p>\n\n  <figure>\n    <img src=\"/assets/images/bbt1.png\" alt=\"bbt account details image\" class=\"case-study-img\"/>\n    <figcaption>See if you can find the specific account settings</figcaption>\n  </figure>\n\n  <p>\n    The account settings that individuals were trying to find was specifc to the account that was selected and not your entire profile settings, which you could find in profile &amp; settings located in the navigation. If you cannot find it, you would click on Manage Account on the right rail with the account links. The first recommendation I suggested was to make a content change. If the content does not tell you what you are clicking on, chances are the content is wrong. For alignment and consistency, that recommendation fell through the cracks. My second recommendation was to put secondary text under the account. \n  </p>\n\n  <figure>\n    <img src=\"/assets/images/bbt2.png\" alt=\"bbt account details image\" class=\"case-study-img\"/>\n    <figcaption>Where do you order checks?</figcaption>\n  </figure>\n\n  <p>\n    This recommendation was tested with users and came back as a successful solution.

This was designed a long time ago, but I leave it on my portfolio to have a baseline for all future work. When I was tasked to create a website for the church, the site had to be able to allow the members to keep up with updates and closings and cancellations. Since I would not be responsible for updating the website with all of the notifications, I decided that I would build the site on a content management system (CMS). After researching a few options, I chose WordPress because it would be easy to train members from the church on how to make updates, add content, and add users.\n  </p>\n\n  <img src=\"/assets/images/meatcamp.jpg\" alt=\"meat camp church website\" class=\"max-img\" />\n</div>","import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';\n\n@Component({\n  selector: 'app-est-header',\n  templateUrl: './est-header.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./est-header.component.scss']\n})\nexport class EstHeaderComponent implements OnInit {\n  navShow = false;\n \n  navToggle() {\n    this.navShow = !this.navShow;\n  }\n\n  constructor() { }\n\n  ngOnInit(): void {\n  }\n\n}\n","<div class=\"header\">\n    <a (click)=\"navToggle()\" class=\"hamburguesa\">\n        <div class=\"res-nav\" [ngClass]=\"{'open' : navShow}\">\n            <span></span>\n            <span></span>\n            <span></span>\n        </div>\n    </a>\n</div>\n\n\n<div *ngIf=\"navShow\" class=\"main-navigation\" [ngClass]=\"{'open' : navShow}\">\n  <div class=\"nav-links\">\n    <a routerLink=\"/home\" routerLinkActive=\"active-nav-selection\" (click)=\"navToggle()\">Home</a>\n    <a routerLink=\"/workshop\" routerLinkActive=\"active-nav-selection\" (click)=\"navToggle()\">Workshop</a>\n    <a href=\"https://elijahtownsend.blogspot.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Journal</a>\n  </div>\n</div>","import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';\n\n@Component({\n  selector: 'app-est-components',\n  templateUrl: './est-components.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./est-components.component.scss']\n})\nexport class EstComponentsComponent implements OnInit {\n\n  constructor() { }\n\n  ngOnInit(): void {\n  }\n\n}\n","<p>est-components works!</p>\n","import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';\n\n@Component({\n  selector: 'app-page-not-found',\n  templateUrl: './page-not-found.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./page-not-found.component.scss']\n})\nexport class PageNotFoundComponent implements OnInit {\n\n  constructor() { }\n\n  ngOnInit(): void {\n  }\n\n}\n","<div class=\"center-row\">\n  <h1>Oops!

We merged a year and a half into my tenure with BB&T. Once we merged, it was an exciting time and gave everyone a lot of opportunities to grow and try something new at the company. I decided to step more into a front-end developer role and help lead the retail web team in developing the retail web platform. It was fun to work with such knowledgable people in a fast driven environment. Let's take a look at some of the application that I helped to develop. The numbers are changed because this is now a live site. Our web application was developed in the JavaScript framework, Angular. I personally enjoyed learning Angular because it allowed me to use it moving forward in future projects. Creating components and working with a design system was amazing. The structure of the enterprise was we had a design systems team who create enterprise wide components and patterns. The next level, which is the level I was on, Retail, was the areas of focus teams. We incorporated the design system into our project and if we created a component that other teams needed, we could push the component into the design system where it would be tested and absorbed by the DS. Due to being a bank, we had to focus on accessibility and make sure everything was designed and coded to standard.\n  </p>\n\n  <figure class=\"est-margin-bottom-lg\">\n    <img src=\"/assets/images/truist1.png\" alt=\"truist retail web page image\" />\n    <figcaption>Truist Retail</figcaption>\n  </figure>\n\n  <figure class=\"est-margin-bottom-lg\">\n    <img src=\"/assets/images/truist2.png\" alt=\"truist retail web page image\" />\n    <figcaption>Truist Retail</figcaption>\n  </figure>\n</div>\n","import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';\n\n@Component({\n  selector: 'app-findcenter',\n  templateUrl: './findcenter.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['../../workshop.component.scss']\n})\nexport class FindcenterComponent implements OnInit {\n\n  constructor() { }\n\n  ngOnInit(): void {\n  }\n\n}\n","<est-project-entry\n  projectTitle=\"FindCenter\"\n  projectLink=\"https://www.findcenter.com/\"\n  projectLinkName=\"View FindCenter\"\n  projectYear=\"2021\"\n>\n  <ul class=\"color-scheme-list\">\n    <li style=\"background: #B14E27\"></li>\n    <li style=\"background: #4264A4\"></li>\n    <li style=\"background: #FFF8EF\"></li>\n  </ul>\n</est-project-entry>\n\n<div class=\"clear\"></div>\n\n<div class=\"row\">\n  <p class=\"entry\">\n    At FindCenter, I was the only Experience Designer on the team. That gave me a lot of opportunities and put me into a position of driving the direction for the web platform.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    The website was already built and had a pre-set of styles so I would work on the site iteratively to work out user experience issues and update the patterns of the site. The tools I would use on a regular basis was Figma, Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator, Zeplin and if we had to create a how-to video, Premiere Rush. Here is what the home page looked like after a few iterative designs based on user feedback.\n  </p>\n\n  <img src=\"/assets/images/findcenter1.jpg\" alt=\"findcenter website\" class=\"max-img\" />\n\n  <p>\n    I not only worked on the entire site, I also worked on marketing campaigns and helped design landing pages that would convert sign ups for the platform. For the landing pages, we had an awesome designer create the illustrations and I incorporated them into the design to make relatable visuals and key pieces of information to increase sign up.\n  </p>\n\n  <figure class=\"est-margin-bottom-lg\">\n    <img src=\"/assets/images/findcenter2.jpg\" alt=\"findcenter landing page image\" />\n    <figcaption>FindCenter Landing Page 1</figcaption>\n  </figure>\n\n  <figure class=\"est-margin-bottom-lg\">\n    <img src=\"/assets/images/findcenter3.jpg\" alt=\"findcenter landing page image\" />\n    <figcaption>FindCenter Landing Page 2</figcaption>\n  </figure>\n</div>\n","import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';\nimport { Routes, RouterModule } from '@angular/router';\nimport { HomePageComponent } from '../../projects/home-page/home-page.component';\nimport { WorkshopComponent } from '../../projects/workshop/workshop.component';\nimport { PageNotFoundComponent } from '../../projects/page-not-found/page-not-found.component';\nimport { MeatCampChurchComponent } from '../../projects/workshop/est-projects/meat-camp-church/meat-camp-church.component';\nimport { OdflComponent } from '../../projects/workshop/est-projects/odfl/odfl.component';\nimport { WhatIsCyclingComponent } from '../../projects/workshop/est-projects/what-is-cycling/what-is-cycling.component';\nimport { OdMoveComponent } from '../../projects/workshop/est-projects/od-move/od-move.component';\nimport { BranchBankingTrustComponent } from '../../projects/workshop/est-projects/branch-banking-trust/branch-banking-trust.component';\nimport { FixieAppComponent } from '../../projects/workshop/est-projects/fixie-app/fixie-app.component';\nimport { TapplesBankingComponent } from '../../projects/workshop/est-projects/tapples-banking/tapples-banking.component';\nimport { HorizontalTimelineComponent } from '../../projects/workshop/est-projects/horizontal-timeline/horizontal-timeline.component';\nimport { EstablishedSixteenComponent } from '../../projects/workshop/est-projects/established-sixteen/established-sixteen.component';\nimport { TruistOlbComponent } from '../../projects/workshop/est-projects/truist-olb/truist-olb.component';\nimport { FindcenterComponent } from '../../projects/workshop/est-projects/findcenter/findcenter.component';\n\nconst routes: Routes = [\n  {\n    path: '',\n    redirectTo: 'home',\n    pathMatch: 'full'\n  },\n\n  {\n    path: 'home',\n    component: HomePageComponent,\n    data: {title: 'Est.1992 -
