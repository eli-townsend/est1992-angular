    OD Move is a customer facing service provided by Old Dominion Freight Line, also known as OD Household Services. If you are moving, you can order a trailer, fill it with your belongings and get it delivered to your new location.

    The new site is an opening into a new market which will bring in more revenue for the company. Being the lead designer for this project, I was able to meet with the business to obtain specs and ask questions about how the site and business were going to work together. In meeting with the business, we had to distinguish what the requirements were while meeting with users to validate the user experience we had designed. One key improvement towards the initial process was by investigating, researching, and testing our Instant Estimate. We white boarded different scenarios but ultimately created a great product by simplifying this process for a decrease of 50% of user clicks to get through the entire application.

    Before we get into the rest of branding and the design of the website, I want to draw your attention to the Instant Estimate. The overall goal was to create a simpler process for the customer. The old Instant Estimate required too much information than what was actually needed to submit the form. It turned out that the reason that all of this information was needed was for marketing so they could send out offers and keep the clients in the loop. We still did not feel like that was a good enough reason to force the user's hand in fillng out the information this early in the process. The user is more than likely going through numerous services and trying to get the lowest quote possible, therefore, we want to provide them with the Instant Estimate as quickly as we can. After simplifying the process down to Origin Zip, Destination Zip, Moving Date and Size of the move, we then moved the marketing information to the following step. We took a nine step form for the initial Instant Estimate down to a four step form. This allowed for quicker quotes, while also allowing the marketing department to get the information they needed to supply the users with discounts, how-to videos, and potential offers.

    After we established the direction with the brand of the site, we focused next on the hierarchy and structure. We presented two ideas for the layout of the site. First, we designed a full width and height website where each page took up the entire viewport with no scrolling. The second design was a single page scroll until you filled out the form to quote your move. That form would take you to another page in the flow. Here are examples of mockups that were presented to the business.

    The decision was made that we were going to be designing for a single page scroll site. Single page scroll sites are nice because you do not have to worry about linking and other page designs, but you do have to worry about animation and making sure the hierarchy of the page keeps the user moving down the page or completing the desired outcome. Here is the live site as of 2018.
