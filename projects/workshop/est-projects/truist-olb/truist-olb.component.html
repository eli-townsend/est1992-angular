    When BB&amp;T and SunTrust merged to form Truist, I remained on the retail team as a front-end developer. It was fun to work with such knowledgable people in a fast driven environment. Let's take a look at some of the application that I helped to develop.

    The numbers are changed because this is now a live site. Our web application was developed in the JavaScript framework, Angular. I personally enjoyed learning Angular because it allowed me to use it moving forward in future projects...like this website! Creating components and working with a design system was amazing. The structure of the enterprise was we had a design systems team who create enterprise wide components and patterns. The next level, which is the level I was on, Retail, was the areas of focus teams. We incorporated the design system into our project and if we created a component that other teams needed, we could push the component into the design system where it would be tested and absorbed by the DS.
