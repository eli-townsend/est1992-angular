    Old Dominion Freight Line (ODFL) is a LTL truckload shipping company that is based out of Thomasville, North Carolina. You might not know who ODFL is, but think of them as UPS and Fedex's biggest competition.

    As a lead designer for Old Dominion Freight Line, my team was tasked with modernizing the external website along with applications and to build everything on a responsive framework. Looking at the old website, the header was so busy that it felt impossible to find what you are looking for (the screenshot does not show the chaos in the dropdowns) and the footer became a catch all for any link that needed to be on the site but did not require priority in the hierarchy.

    Once we began to dissect the old site through card sorting and establishing the hierarchy of the site's content, we began creating <a href="http://styletil.es/" target="_blank">style tiles</a> to start getting approval for site branding. While the style tiles were in the review process, we then began to create lo-fidelity mockups to present to the product owners.

    The mockups displayed a cleaner look for the header and footer along with different home/landing page layouts. Once we were able to define and provide the understanding of responsive design and mobile first, the business was on board with the direction that we were moving in. My team then created two hi-fidelity mockups for the business so that they could make the decision on styles. We went through many iterations of design critiquing layout, changing color schemes and textures for business approval. ODFL.com was developed mobile first and simplified the process on numerous applications by removing steps to reach the same success criteria.

  <p>ODFL is very form and data heavy, therefore, simplifying the applications for customers saved them time and provided a service they trusted. ODFL.com had 30,000+ daily users and generated over $3 billion dollars (2016). With 75% of the companies revenue coming from the website, we did extensive testing on the web applications utilizing Google Analytics to solidify our design decisions. If we saw a pattern of a high bounce rate through an application flow, we had to be able to pin point what the friction was and solve the issue, then we would reiterate this process.

    Of course when you give users something completely new, they have trouble adapting because it looks different. Once customers were using the new website, many of the experiences were simplified or more functionality was added and they loved it. This was my first project at a corporate level and it was a great learning experience.
