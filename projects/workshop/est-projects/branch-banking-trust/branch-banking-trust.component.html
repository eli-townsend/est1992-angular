    As one of my first freelance projects, I was able to create the first website for Meat Camp Baptist Church. This was designed a long time ago, but I leave it on my portfolio to have a baseline for all future work. When I was tasked to create a website for the church, the website had to be able to allow the members to keep up with updates, closings and cancellations. Since I would not be responsible for updating the website with all of the notifications, I decided that I would build the site on a content management system (CMS). After researching a few options, I chose WordPress because it would be easy to train members from the church on how to make updates, add content, and add users.
