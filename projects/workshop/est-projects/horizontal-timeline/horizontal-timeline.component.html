    Transactional is a fictional company I created to depict the real world scenario I was put in. Due to a NDA (Non-Disclosure Agreement), I cannot go over the full app in the design, but I want to focus on a key design element.

     At my previous employer, as the lead for the project, Transactional was an application that would show the user the entire lifecycle of a PRO#. Once a dock worker or driver would scan the PRO#, it would add a new step in the PRO# lifecycle. This application is used by eighty percent of the departments in the company which already puts a strain on the design process. Instead of using the tradition ui/ux design process, everyone wanted a say in the application's design and it turned into a design by committee. The issue with the older version of the app was that there was not a good way to change from step to step. The key feature that was requested was the ability to easily transition from one step in the process to the next and the ability to go back. In the ideation phase of the design process, I presented the idea of using a horizontal timeline to show each step in the lifecycle. Different groups wanted different features, but the horizontal timeline was one solution because you could use the mouse to change points but also be able to use the arrow keys to change points. Certain teams were very reliant on the keyboard for quicker production, so the solution had to take into account keyboard usage. We also created a active tooltip to label which step you are in the process. Another piece of functionality is the hover effect tooltip for non-active points. This showed the user which step was next or previous but gave them the ability to jump multiple steps.

    This experience was a great learning tool in setting expectations for a project, not letting the scope grow and properly define deliverables. It also provided a chance to improve my public speaking skills and handle difficult conversations in the moment while maintaining professionalism throughout the meeting.
